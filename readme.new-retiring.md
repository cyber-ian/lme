The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has made the decision to retire Logging Made Easy (LME).<br>
This GitHub page will be open and maintained until **31st March 2023** after which time it will be removed, and LME will no longer be supported by the NCSC.


The decision to remove LME is part of a wider reprioritisation exercise by the NCSC to focus critical resources on higher impact initiatives which continue to protect the UK's cyber infrastructure.


A blog providing more detail around the decision and LME alternatives can be found [here](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/ncsc-to-retire-logging-made-easy)
